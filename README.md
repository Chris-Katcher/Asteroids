# Asteroids
Classic Asteroids game written in processing.

The game features several modes with increasing difficulty up to computer mode, a mode so difficult it should only be attempted by computers!

It features some very eye catching pixel art created by myself but more importantly, an original sound track created by the one and only Vector Project (soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/vectorproject).

This project gave me some awesome experience in core game concepts as well as gave me the chance to work on implimenting in game sound.

To play the game, download "Asteroids for Computers (x64).zip", extract the contents of the directory and run "Katcher_asteroids".
